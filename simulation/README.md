# Simulation Tests

Simulation tests are black box tests that can be run against a cadence cluster. 
They allow complex scenarios that require multiple components to be tested in a regular, systematic way. 

If you find yourself running manual sanity checks on your code using exposed RPCs that scenario is probably a good candidate for a simulation test. 

## Structure

There are currently three different targets for the simulation tests:

- matching
- history
- replication

// write about each of them in a short paragraph

## Adding New Simulations

### Conventions

... 

### CI/CD For Simulations

// when are simulations run in ci/cd
// how do you ensure your new simulation is running in ci/cd

## Running Simulations

// write stuff here
// how do you run it locally
// how do you run a single sim locally
// how do you run multiple locally
